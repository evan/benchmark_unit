== Features

* Test::Unit-compatible
* machine-independent measurement units

== Installation

  sudo gem install benchmark_unit

== Usage

First, require the library. Then, in a regular Test::Unit::TestCase, call either <tt>assert_faster</tt> or <tt>assert_slower</tt>. Pass a number of RubySeconds and a block to benchmark. 

  require 'benchmark/unit'
  
  class BenchmarkUnitTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    
    def test_speed_of_critical_method
      assert_faster(3) do
        MyCriticalMethod("data")
      end
    end
      
  end

You do not have to manually run the block multiple times; the library does that for you.
  
To find how many RubySeconds to start with, just omit the argument to the <tt>assert_faster</tt> or <tt>assert_slower</tt> call. The test will fail and report how long your block took. Add a little bit and use that as your initial failure point.

See Benchmark::RubySeconds for more details.
